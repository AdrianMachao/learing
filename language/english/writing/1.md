Andrew perents a compelling argument in favor of promoting student sports activities. Admittedly, sport participation is an zexcellent means to  promote students' physical health. However,considering the university's responsibilities in promoting academic perrminence , I am inclined to prioritize the construction of a new library.In my view, A well-equipped library, serving as a platform for academic exchange and cooperation, can enhance teaching and scholarly communication. not only provides access to print books but also offer high-speed internet connnectivity and databases for interdisciplineary collaborations.For example, both faculty and students in our Architecture Department require establishing a new library that enhances networks across departments, which will significantly enrich the interdisciplinary research database.
