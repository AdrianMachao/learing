# in which
“in which”的具体含义取决于其修饰的先行词类型：若先行词表示地点，则“in which”等同于“where”，作地点状语；若先行词表示时间，则等同于“when”，作时间状语。这一区别源于定语从句中关系词的语法功能与先行词的逻辑关联性。

一、当先行词为地点时，“in which”等于“where”
当定语从句修饰的先行词是具体或抽象的地点名词（如city， room， situation等）时，“in which”与“where”可互换使用，此时“in which”在从句中充当地点状语。例如：

This is the library ​where​ students study quietly.（先行词library为地点）
This is the library ​in which​ students study quietly.（语义与结构完全等同）

二、当先行词为时间时，“in which”等于“when”
若先行词表示时间段或时间点（如year， period， moment等），则“in which”相当于“when”，在从句中作时间状语。例如：

I still remember the day ​when​ we first met.（先行词day为时间）
I still remember the day ​in which​ we first met.（两者均描述具体日期
